# Contributing to Monad Token List

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Monad Token List! This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new token to the repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.9 or higher** installed on your system
- [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (a Python package installer and resolver)
- **Access to a Monad RPC endpoint**

## Token Requirements

To be added to the Monad Token List, your token must meet the following requirements:

- **Deployed on Monad Mainnet**
- **ERC20-compliant**
- **Decimals** (must be between 6 and 36)
- **Logo file** (must provide a logo in SVG or PNG format)
- **Directory naming** (the directory name must exactly match the token symbol)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork this repository to your GitHub account, then clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/token-list.git
cd token-list
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Monad RPC URL if you don't want to use the default RPC:

```bash
echo "MONAD_RPC_URL=https://your-monad-rpc-endpoint" > .env
```

Replace `https://your-monad-rpc-endpoint` with your actual RPC URL.

### 4. Run the Add Token Script

Use the `add_token.py` script to automatically fetch token information from the blockchain:

```bash
# With token address as argument
uv run python scripts/add_token.py 0xYourTokenAddress

# Or run interactively (you'll be prompted for the address)
uv run python scripts/add_token.py

# With token address as argument and custom RPC
uv run --env-file=.env python scripts/add_token.py 0xYourTokenAddress
```

The script will generate a `data.json` file with the token metadata.

### 5. Add a Logo File

After the script completes, you need to manually add a logo file to the token's directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the token directory (replace SYMBOL with your token's symbol)
cd mainnet/SYMBOL/

# Add your logo file (either SVG or PNG format)
# The file must be named exactly "logo.svg" or "logo.png"
```

**Logo Requirements:**

- File name must be exactly `logo.svg` or `logo.png`
- Preferably use SVG format for scalability
- Image should be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Minimum dimensions: min 200x200 pixels, preferably 256x256
- Optimized for web display (keep file size reasonable)

### 6. Validate Your Token

Before submitting your changes, run the validation script to ensure everything is correct:

```bash
uv run python scripts/validate_tokens.py
```

### 7. Commit and Create Pull Request

Once validation passes, commit your changes and create a pull request on GitHub with:

- A clear title (e.g., "Add SYMBOL token")
- Description including the token contract address
- Any additional relevant information about the token

**Note:** The token list file (`tokenlist-mainnet.json`) is automatically regenerated by a GitHub Action when your PR is merged. You don't need to run `generate_token_list_file.py` manually or include changes to this file in your PR.

## Data Format

The `data.json` file contains the following fields:

```json
{
  "chainId": 143,
  "address": "0xYourTokenAddress",
  "name": "Token Name",
  "symbol": "TKN",
  "decimals": 18,
  "extensions": {
    "coinGeckoId": "token-id",
    "bridgeInfo": {
      "protocol": "bridge-protocol",
      "bridgeAddress": "0xTokenBridgeAddress"
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Fields

- `chainId`: Always `143` for Monad Mainnet
- `address`: The token's contract address (checksummed)
- `name`: The full name of the token (must match the on-chain `name()` value)
- `symbol`: The token symbol (must match the on-chain `symbol()` value and directory name)
- `decimals`: The number of decimal places the token uses (must match the on-chain `decimals()` value)

### Optional Fields

- `extensions`: Additional metadata about the token
  - `coinGeckoId`: The CoinGecko API ID for the token (if listed on CoinGecko)
  - `bridgeInfo`: Bridge information for bridged tokens

## Important Notes

### Disclaimer

This list serves as a resource for token issuers to submit token metadata for convenience and interoperability across ecosystem protocols, apps and interfaces. Inclusion of a token in this list does not imply endorsement, verification, or approval. No due diligence or verification is performed on token issuers or associated projects. It is imperative to conduct your own research before engaging with any token.
